<h1>Howdy!</h1>

<p>If you're seeing this, you're a friend, a fellow programmer, a future employer, a complete stranger, or preferably, some combination of the above.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm Matt, and I'm really really close to finishing my Computer Science degree at <a href="cs.pitt.edu" title="Like, two finals away. Really.">Pitt</a>.
Currently, I'm seeking full-time employment in a position that will allow me to continue learning the state-of-the-art in web dev and design things people will find useful.</p>
<br>
<p>I originally hail from Harrisburg, and came to Pittsburgh in 2008 with absolutely zero intention of doing anything with computers at all.
My first <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/undergrad/courses/cs0401.php" title="Never again.">CS course</a> was in the summer of 2010 and first
<a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~ramirez/cs1520/" title="I forgot how much I loved this class until I started tutoring for it.">web programming class</a>
in the summer of 2011. I like programming, but I love web programming. Most of the really awesome projects we did in class up until that point were written
in Java and confined to the command line or an IDE. As a result, I couldn't share my enthusiasm with any of my friends or family, and grew frustrated
at the difficulty of making something that was useful to non-programmers.</p>
<br>
<p>Learning to program in PHP and Javascript changed all that--here was an inherently visual way of writing instantly gratifying programs
that I could share with anyone who knows how to internet. I felt empowered to solve the problems I had heretofore only been able to complain about (see <a href='spreadsheet'>Spreadsheet</a> and
<a href='ipa-chart' title="Not to be confused with India Pale Ale.">IPA</a>).
Anything I could visualize I could create. Keeping myself from spending all my time programming quickly became much more difficult than the programming itself.
Learning new technologies and paradigms became a pleasure and a relief (and in the case of <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a>, a suspicion that I was dabbling in witchcraft).</p>
